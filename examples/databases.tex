Our second example is a type-safe relational algebra Databases are one of the pillars of modern software. Databases are employed in
everything from social media software \cite{tao} to flight scheduling and
booking \cite{flights}. Different programming languages have varying interfaces
for querying an SQL database. Oftentimes, a query and response interface simply
asks a user to send and receive a SQL query and as a string and to process a
response given as a string. While this offers flexibility, it means that there
is no compile-time guarantee of correctness and that poorly written SQL queries
result in run-time crashes, rather than compile-time debugging. We would like to
be able to easily compose types from database table schema, which would allow a
programmer to easily compose type-safe queries with compile-time verification of
correctness \cite{power_of_pi}. Many SQL interfaces do runtime type checking,
meaning if we can avoid these type checks, there may be performance gains.

In this example, we are going to build up a simple dependently-typed relational
algebra in Idris. This relational algebra is going to allow us to read from a
database and also do a cartesian product. Let's say, for example, that I am a
registrar at a college have a table of students and a table of classes, and I
want to enroll each student in all the classes in the class table. In other
words I would want to compute the cartesian product of these tables, making sure
that they contain disjoint schema. Such an operation is shown in the following
tables. Table~\ref{students} shows a table of students, Table~\ref{classes} is a
table of classes and Table~\ref{cartesian_product} is the cartesian product of
the two tables.

    \begin{lstlisting}
        Attribute : Type
        (String, U)

        Schema : Type
        List Attribute

        Students : Schema
        Students = (   ("name", STRING)}
                    :: ("id", VECT 6 CHAR)} 
                    :: ("classyear", VECT 4 CHAR)}
                    :: Nil)

        data Row : Schema -> Type where
            EmptyRow : Row Nil
            ConsRow : el u -> Row s -> Row ((name, u) :: s)

        kevin : Row Students
        kevin = ConsRow "Kevin Jiah-Chih Liao"
            (ConsRow ('1'::'2'::'3'::'4'::'5'::'6'::Nil)
            (ConsRow ('2'::'0'::'1'::'8'::Nil) EmptyRow))
    \end{lstlisting}
\end{figure}

We can start by defining types to represent a database schema. A database table
refers to rows of data that correspond to a declared schema. A schema is a list
of attributes that each element should have. An attribute is simply a column
name and the type of what the column contains. Thus, we can declare an
attributes and schemas as follows in Figure~\ref{schema}, where U refers to the
universe that we built in an earlier example. 

Given that we built a schema, we are now able to define a schema to hold
students. Take, for example, a schema that stores a student's name, student id,
and class year. Our next job is to be able to express a database table with a
row of instances of a schema. This is reflected in our declaration of the
\texttt{Row} type, which lets us join rows together, ending in an EmptyRow. An
example \texttt{kevin} is provided. 

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \caption{Declaration of connect. Idris adaption of code from Power of Pi
    \protect\cite{power_of_pi}}
    \label{connect}
    \begin{lstlisting}
        -- Connect takes in a server name, a table name, 
        -- and a schema, and executes IO operations on that table. 
        -- This type ensures that upon connection, if successful, 
        -- the table on the server must have the same schema. 
        connect : String -> String -> (s : Schema) -> IO (Handle s)

        -- Tells us if two schemas are disjoint. 
        disjoint : Schema -> Schema -> Bool

        -- A simple proposition that stops any false proposition from compiling
        So Bool -> Type
        So True = Unit
        So False = Void

        -- Only modeling Read and Product RA expressions.
        data RA : Schema -> Type where
            Read : Handle s -> RA s
            Product : (So $ disjoint s s') => RA s -> RA s' -> RA (append s s')
        
        -- Takes in a query written with our relational algebra and then 
        -- sends back a table that corresponds to our schema. 
        toSQL : RA s -> IO (List (Row s))
    \end{lstlisting}
\end{figure}

Now that we've defined the schema and tables, it's time to show how we connect
and query the table. Usually this means that we have a function \texttt{connect}
that takes in a servername and tablename as strings, and a SQL query as a
string, before returning a string in an IO monad. Now that we've defined a
schema type, we can build a well-typed database connection that validates that
the database table we are connecting to is of the same schema as the schema we
are requesting. If connection succeeds, that means that all subsequent requests
with the \texttt{Handle schema} type returned by the connect function must be
safe, because we know that the schemas we are reading or writing from the table
must correspond to the schema in our code. This connect function is defined in
Figure ~\ref{connect}. 

Finally, we define a type \texttt{RA} which denotes expressions in our
relational algebra. For the sake of brevity, we've limited it to \texttt{Read}
and \texttt{Product}. We then have a function that does an IO operation on a
database, taking in a query of type Relational Algebra, to return us a database
table of consisting of the results of our query. 

\texttt{Product} computes the Cartesian product of two tables, producing a
larger table where each row in the first table maps to every row in the second
table. This operation only works if the two schemas are disjoint. While it is
trivial to write a function \texttt{disjoint} that checks to see if two schemas
are disjoint, we want to enforce that product is only a valid RA expression on
disjoint schemas. Thus, we want the type of \texttt{Product} to enforce that its
two schemas are disjoint. In addition, we have a simple proposition \texttt{So}
that ensures that whatever proposition is supplied to it is valid. In the case
of building a cartesian product, we are looking to make sure that the two
schemas are disjoint. 

Let's say that I now have to do the registrar cartesian product that I described
in the beginning of this section. What I'd first do is make two calls to the
\texttt{connect} function. I will send the schema of my students table in one
call and the schema of the classes call in another. If both connections succeed,
I will be given two values of type \texttt{Handle Student}, \texttt{Handle
Class} respectively, which give me the certainty that the table contains data
conforming to such a schema. I can then feed these two \texttt{Handle} values into a
\texttt{Read} expression, which will give me values of table rows of type
\texttt{RA Student} and \texttt{RA Class}. I can then take the cartesian
product. My \texttt{Product} expression first checks to make sure that the
\texttt{Student} schema and \texttt{Class} schema are disjoint, which they are,
before appending the \texttt{Class} schema to the \texttt{Student} schema to
make the final schema that describes the rows of data held by the results of our
cartesian product of two tables. 

Thus, in this example, we've shown the potential for dependent types to build a
type safe database, where if the schemas match on connection, all subsequent
queries should be type safe. While there was some overhead in setting up the
types, once the database software is written, declaring a schema with elements
in our universe was pretty easy and database queries not significantly more
difficult to compose and write. Thus, this is an exciting application of
dependent types where programmers can potentially benefit from high-level use of
dependently typed software once the more complex moving parts are written. 

We circle back to a question that we've been asking earlier: in what ways does
this overhead give us an advantage over an ordinary database driver? Earlier, we
were discussing how an ordinary database driver will usually send a query over
to the database as a string and receive data as a string. What this means is
that a database driver will have to validate whether data conforms to the schema
specified by a user on every read operation. By specifying type levels
