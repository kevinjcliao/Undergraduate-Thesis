General purpose dependently typed programming languages such as Idris (and in
the future, Haskell), allow programmers to integrate dependent types into lower
level work than a theorem proving language would allow. This section of the
literature review will take a look at Brady's \textit{Idris: Systems Programming
Meets Full Dependent Types} \cite{idris_systems_programming}.
