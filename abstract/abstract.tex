Programs crash. Static type systems serve to make the life of a programmer
easier by providing static compile-time guarantees of certain program behaviour,
guaranteeing that a function will map from a domain to a co-domain. A
dependently typed programming language gives a programmer even more additional
expressive power, allowing types to be expressed relative to values. In this
thesis, I start by reviewing practical applications of dependent types. I then
present a vote counter for the STV algorithm written in Idris, a dependently
typed programming language. I demostrate that writing a counter in such a
language gives me both termination guarantees and guarantees of cardinality. I
also provide opportunities for future work to produce a counter with stronger
guarantees of correctness.
