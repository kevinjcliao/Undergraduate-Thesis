abstract="We formalise a variant of the Single Transferable Vote scheme with fractional transfer values in the theorem prover Coq. Our method advocates the idea of vote counting as application of a sequence of rules. The rules are an intermediate step for specifying the protocol for vote-counting in a precise symbolic language. We then formalise these rules in Coq. This reduces the gap between the legislation and formalisation so that, without knowledge of formal methods, one can still validate the process. Moreover our encoding is modular which enables us to capture other Single Transferable Vote schemes without significant changes. Using the built-in extraction mechanism of Coq, a Haskell program is extracted automatically. This program is guaranteed to meet its specification. Each run of the program outputs a certificate which is a precise, independently checkable record of the trace of computation and provides all relevant details of how the final result is obtained. This establishes correctness, reliability, and verifiability of the count.",

 abstract = {We give evidence that Single Tranferable Vote (STV) is computationally resistant to manipulation : It is NP-complete to determine whether there exists a (possibly insincere) preference that will elect a favored candíate, even in an election for a single seat. Thus strategic voting under STV is qualitatively more difficult than under other commonly-used voting schemes. Furthermore, this resistance to manipulation is inherent to STV and does not depend on hopeful extraneous assumptions like the presumed difficulty of learning the preferences of the other voters. We also prove that it is NP-complete to recognize when an STV election violates monotonicity. This suggests that non-monotonicity in STV elections might be perceived as less threatening since it is in effect "hidden" and hard to exploit for strategic advantage.},

This essay specifically seeks to contrast the Single Transferable Vote system with two other voting algorithms (Modified Sainte-Laguë and First-Past-The-Post), by constructing Java implementations of the algorithms and running example data through them. Thus, the suitability of a possible real-life implementation of the Single Transferable Vote method in a Swedish parliament context is evaluated. Furthermore, an alternative version of the original STV method which has been modified to fit these conditions is suggested. The effects of such an implementation on election outcomes are not entirely conclusive, and the conclusion is that more research is needed before a definite evaluation can be made.  },
