\section{Introduction}
Programs crash. Static type systems serve to make the life of a programmer
easier by providing static compile-time guarantees of certain program behaviour,
guaranteeing that a function will map from a domain to a co-domain. A
dependently typed programming language gives a programmer even additional
expressive power, allowing types to be expressed relative to values given at
runtime. For example, consider a function \textit{replicate}, that takes in any
Peano natural number $n$ and returns a length-indexed vector of $n$ Peano
natural numbers of the value $n$. We can express this in Idris, a
dependently typed functional programming language, as follows in Figure
~\ref{replicate_in_idris}. 

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \caption{Implementation of Replicate in Idris}
  \label{replicate_in_idris}
  \begin{lstlisting}
    -- replic 3 will give us (3 :: 3 :: 3 :: Nil)
    replic : (n : Nat) -> Vect n Nat
    replic n = replHelp n n where
      replHelp : (n : Nat) -> Nat -> Vect n Nat
      replHelp Z _ = Nil
      replHelp (S n) val = (val :: replHelp n val)
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{figure}

Thus, the co-domain of our function is dependent upon some value that is
provided at runtime. Calling \texttt{replic 5} will limit the co-domain of the
function to all length-indexed vectors of length 5, etc. Having written this
type, a programmer now has compile-time guarantees that the logic for a function
was expressed correctly and behaviour will correspond closer to what is
expected.

While research in dependent types has traditionally been in the domains of
theoretical mathematics, where researchers use dependently typed theorem provers
to write mathematical formalisms, dependent types have applications outside of
such a theoretical domain. In my work, I seek to find patterns in the existing
body of literature around practical applications of dependent types. My goal is
to enumerate signs that a programmer should look for that the solution to a
problem could benefit from the use of dependent types. 

\section{Work Covered}
This review is a tour of potential applications of dependent types. In this
abstract, I have chosen a brief example, units of measurement, in order to
demonstrate their potency. However, in addition to units of measurement,
dependent types have far ranging applications. A poster of my research would
contain a couple of the applications which I am exploring: 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Complicated pattern matching in the Cryptol DSL for cryptographic
  applications. \cite{power_of_pi}
  \item Generating file format parsers from a data description language.
  \cite{power_of_pi}
  \item A relational database and algebra. \cite{power_of_pi, eisenberg2016}
  \item An alternative to monadic transformations with an algebraic effects DSL
  \cite{algebraic}
  \item Programming distributed systems with F* and dependent types.
  \cite{fstar_distributed_programming}
  \item A low-level domain-specific language demonstrating the applicability of
  dependent types to systems programming. \cite{idris_systems_programming}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusions}
Through a review of the practical applications of dependent types in existing
and implemented functional programming languages, I demonstrate that while
dependent types are often thought of as far-off and theoretical, they are
currently available in advanced functional programming languages and serve
practical purposes. 

I set out to look for patterns that signal to a programmer that dependent types
would be particularly useful for their work. So far, I've found that the
problems that I'm exploring seem to be focused around two main themes: the
serializing and deserializing of data, and building domain-specific languages.
As I continue my research, I will expand on these ideas and make the scenarios
more concrete and identifiable to a programmer, which I hope to present at POPL.
