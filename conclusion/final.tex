\section{Totality Checkers Are Good.}

Guarantees of termination are good for the user. STV vote counting can take a
while. When running the code from Ghale, Gore and Pattinson, counting STV
ballots for an election of the Australian Capital Territory took 3 days
\cite{stv_haskell}. The point is, counting STV elections can be difficult. More
than once, I wondered if the program was not going to terminate. Idris provides
a built-in totality checker, which as specified above, means that there are
compile-time guarantees of termination. This means proofs of termination are not
required. 

% TODO: Papers on totality checker in Haskell? 

While significant, non-trivial barriers exist to implementing a totality checker
in Haskell, the experience I had with implementing an STV counter in Idris leads
me to believe that Haskell would benefit significantly from such a totality
checker. As such, I encourage and add my voice to encourage the people who are
working towards this noble goal.
