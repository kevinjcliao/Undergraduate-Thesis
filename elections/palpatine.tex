\chapter{Introducing Palpatine: An STV Vote Counter in Idris.}

In the following section, I introduce \textit{Palpatine}. \textit{Palpatine}
takes in a list of candidates, seats, and ballots reflecting constituent
preferences and produces a list of judgments. Each candidate is either
eliminated or elected. In this section, I will discuss the code behind
\textit{Palpatine}, first the code that counts ballots and then the code that
parses data files.
