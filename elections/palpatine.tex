\chapter{Introducing Palpatine: An STV Vote Counter in Idris.}

In this section, I introduce Palpatine. Palpatine takes in a list of candidates,
seats, and ballots reflecting constituent preferences and produces a list of
judgments, meaning a list of candidates that are elected and a list that are not
elected. In this section, I will discuss the code behind Palpatine, first the
code that counts ballots and then the code that parses data files.
