\chapter{Relevant Background on the Single Transferrable Vote}

Having provided a grounding in dependently-typed programming, I now move to the
voting system that I take an interest in. I take an interest in the Single
Transferable Vote (STV) system that is used to count voter preferences in many
developed democracies. STV is used in Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and lower
level elections across the United Kingdom and the United States. Many variants
of the system exist and I concern myself with the method of STV currently used
to count votes in the Australian Senate. 

\section{A sample STV election}
\textit{This is an application of a description of the Australian Senate STV Counting Process as described by the Australian Electoral Commision.}

In order to demonstrate how the STV system works, it would help to run a sample
election, provided below. This sample election data is not original and obtained
from prior literature for an STV vote counter in Haskell and Coq
\cite{stv_haskell}. Suppose we have three candidates, $[A, B, C]$, running for
two available seats. Now suppose that we have 5 voters who each have sent in
preferences to be counted. The preferences are shown in
Figure~\ref{sample_election}. Each voter's preferences are referenced by a list
where the leftmost element represents the most preferred candidate and the
rightmost candidate presents the voter's least preferred. There is no obligation
to number all candidates. 


\begin{figure}[ht!!!!!!!!]
    \caption{Ballots for a sample election to be run. }
    \label{sample_election}
    \begin{lstlisting}
        [A,C]
        [A,B,C]
        [A,C,B]
        [B,A]
        [C,B,A]
    \end{lstlisting}
\end{figure}

The first thing to calculate is the \textit{Droop Quota}. This represents the voting `score' a candidate must have before they are elected. The Droop Quota is calculated in the Australian Senate by a formula shown below. 

$$
S = floor(\frac{b}{n + 1}) + 1
$$

In this formula, $b$ refers to the number of ballots, $n$ refers to the number
of seats available, and the \textit{floor} operation refers to rounding the
result down. The Droop Quota of our sample election is, according to this formula, 

$$
S = floor(\frac{5}{2 + 1}) + 1 = floor(\frac{5}{3}) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2
$$

Now, we assign a \textit{weight} to each ballot. Our ballots are now: 

\begin{figure}[ht!!!!!!!!]
    \caption{Ballots with initial score.}
    \label{sample_election2}
    \begin{lstlisting}
        ([A,C], 1)
        ([A,B,C], 1)
        ([A,C,B], 1)
        ([B,A], 1)
        ([C,B,A], 1)
    \end{lstlisting}
\end{figure}

We now start by counting everyone's first preferences. $A$ receives 3 ballots
each with the weight of 1.0. Thus, $A$ has reached the Droop Quota and $A$ is
elected. No one else has hit the Droop Quota yet. Now, we transfer the surplus.
We remove the ``head'' from all the ballots that preferenced A and we transfer
the surplus votes. The new value of the votes is calculated as follows: 

$$
v = s/n
$$

where $v$ is the surplus transfer value, $s$ is the surplus ballots and $n$ is
the total number of ballots that preferenced the candidate first. By applying
this formula, the Droop Quota is 2, there are 3 votes for $A$ and so there is a
surplus of 1. $B, C$ each received one vote. This means the surplus is expressed
by $\frac{1}{3}$. In other words, our ballots now look like: 

\begin{figure}[ht!!!!!!!!]
    \caption{Ballots with initial score.}
    \label{sample_election2}
    \begin{lstlisting}
        ([C], 1/3)
        ([B,C], 1/3)
        ([C,B], 1/3)
        ([B], 1)
        ([C,B], 1)

        elected: [A]

        scores: 
        (B, 1)
        (C, 1)
    \end{lstlisting}
\end{figure}

We then immediately start counting the surplus transfer from our elected candidates. In other words, C gets an increase in score of $\frac{2}{3}$ and $B$ gets an increase in score of $\frac{1}{3}$. The scores of these ballots remain the same. 

\begin{figure}[ht!!!!!!!!]
    \caption{Ballots with initial score.}
    \label{sample_election3}
    \begin{lstlisting}
        ([], 1/3)
        ([C], 1/3)
        ([B], 1/3)
        ([B], 1)
        ([C,B], 1)

        elected: [A]

        scores: 
        (B, 4/3)
        (C, 5/3)
    \end{lstlisting}
\end{figure}

Now, given we have exhausted the surplus of elected candidates and there is
still one vacancy available, we remove the candidate with the lowest score,
which is $B$. We look at the votes that went to candidate $B$. There is one
exhausted ballot $[]$, and another ballot: $[C]$ with transfer value $1/3$. We
transfer this ballot over to $C$. We now have one candidate left in the running
and one seat open. This means that $C$ is elected by virtue of being the only
candidate left. 

The result of our election is thus, $[A,C]$ being elected to the senate.  

\section{Why STV?}
\textit{Coming in final draft of the thesis.} \\
In short, this will be a section on how STV allows someone to genuinely express
their candidate preferences in confidence that their vote will not be ``thrown
away.''
