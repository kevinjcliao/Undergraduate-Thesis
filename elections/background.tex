\chapter{Relevant Background in Voting Systems}

Having provided a grounding in dependently-typed programming, I now move to the
voting system that I take an interest in. I take an interest in the Single
Transferable Vote (STV) system that is used to count voter preferences in many
developed democracies. STV is used in Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and lower
level elections across the United Kingdom and the United States. Many variants
of the system exist and I concern myself with the method of STV currently used
to count votes in the Australian Senate. 

\section{Why STV?}
\textit{Coming in final draft of the thesis.} \\
In short, this will be a section on how STV allows someone to genuinely express
their candidate preferences in confidence that their vote will not be ``thrown
away.''

\section{Benefits and drawbacks of STV in summary}
\textit{Coming in final draft of the thesis.}
