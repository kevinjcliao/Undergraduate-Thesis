\chapter{Review of Existing Literature}

In the previous section, I offered a brief summary of the motivations and
history behind dependent typed programming. Having done so, I now offer an
introduction to different practical applications of dependent types that allow a
programmer to write safer programs through tighter type specifications. These
examples are structured in order of the difficulty I personally found in
understanding them, and I would greatly encourage readers to read in that order.
